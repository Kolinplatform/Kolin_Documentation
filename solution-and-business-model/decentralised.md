# Decentralised

  
Our coin built on a Waves smart contract platform is an open source community-based cryptocurrency which would work on a peer-to-peer decentralized mechanism. It gives users from any part of the world a chance to become independent and have access to translation services \(documents, articles, websites, etc.\) to a variety of languages, by using the Kolin currency for paying to specialised translators via the blockchain, shortening the language barriers within a user-friendly environment.

Kolin tokens are valid indefinitely and are the property of their respective holders
