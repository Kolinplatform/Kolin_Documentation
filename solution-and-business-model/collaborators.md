As UNICEF \(2007\) defines, Education is a key social and cultural right, that promotes democracy, peace, tolerance, development and economic growth. Therefore, Kolin will look forward and support any cooperation within the educative process. We make an open call to specialists in their area to be part of Kolin, where they are going to be able to explain their work in simple words, to incentivise the new generations and help them to have access to technical knowledge in a free and simple format. Schools, Institutes, Universities and private entities are welcome to participate in this project, together with common people that would like to put their grain of sand into the development of new generations.
