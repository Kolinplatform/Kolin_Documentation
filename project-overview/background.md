# Background

Globalization is currently a popular term that can be applied to most interactions performed within Social Networks. Borderless platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, among others, have allowed people worldwide to interact with each other, not just for recreational but also business-related purposes. Although this globalized 21st century has seen an expansion in intercultural relations, still lacks one of the principal communication aspects, a common and understandable language.

The Internet is an excellent channel for breaking barriers comprised on the communication process, but language coding is still an issue. Notwithstanding English is the agreed universal language, there are just 360 million-odd native English speakers, what compared with the world population of 7.6 bn people corresponds just to a 0.04% \(United Nations, 2018\). Chinese and Spanish, on the other hand, are the world most spoken languages with 1.2 billion and 400 million native speakers respectively \(Lane, 2016\). This language barrier limits access to education and business opportunity to most of the global population, making competition harder for those people coming from low-income countries.

During the 2015 World Education Forum, Unesco claimed that Education must be considered as public good, a fundamental human right and as a basis for guaranteeing the realization of other human rights. They also proposed a new vision on his education agenda trying to “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”. As another inclusive example, the UN recognizes six official languages within its sessions, being these Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish \(UN, 2018\). Their correct interpretation and translation, in both spoken and written forms, ensure a proper function of the Organization since 1982 \(Security Council resolution 528\). Additionally, in the year 2000, the world’s governments adopted the six EFA goals and the eight Millennium Development Goals \(MDGs\), the two most important frameworks in the field of Education. These frameworks mention that Education must be inclusive and provide a common language for partnership. In order to follow the UNESCO and MDG suggested directives and considering UN multilingual standards, we created Kolin.

Kolin born as an acronym of "Konscienco Lingvo" which in Esperanto \(constructed international auxiliary language\) means "Conscious Language", referring to the need for language universality and consciousness within the technical language.
