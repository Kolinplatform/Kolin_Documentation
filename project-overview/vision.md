# Vision

Although information and communication technologies \(ICT\) have become global and ubiquitous during the last decades, language continues to be a massive obstacle between people speaking different languages.

Kolin was created for becoming a bridge between different cultures and languages and also to ease access to education. Kolin will become an agent of change by generating multilingual and open technical material and also by offering translation services to private and public entities. Both to make access to knowledge universal, making Kolin a core point for the generation of a more inclusive world.

Following that vision, Kolin born as an acronym of "Konscienco Lingvo" which in Esperanto means "Conscious Language" referring to the need for language universality and also consciousness within the technical language.
