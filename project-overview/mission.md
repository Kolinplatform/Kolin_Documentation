# Mission

Kolin was created for becoming a bridge between different cultures, languages and also to ease access to Education. This goal will be achieved by the creation of the Platform, the first decentralised centre for translation and information exchange. This goal will be achieved by creating the Platform which will use blockchain technology to receive and emit automated payments for services within projects or even crowdfunding performed.
