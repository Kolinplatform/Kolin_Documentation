# Airdrop and Bounties

The Kolin bounty program is an experimental and discretionary rewards program for our active Kolin community to encourage and reward those who are helping to improve the platform. It is not a competition. You should know that we can cancel the Program at any time, and awards are at the sole discretion of KOLIN Bounty Panel. You are responsible to comply with your country taxes regulations. All awards are subject to applicable law. Finally, you must not violate any law or compromise any data that is not yours for participating in these bounty programs.
