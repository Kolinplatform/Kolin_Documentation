# Waves Platform smart contracts

Waves Platform is a global public blockchain platform, providing functionality for implementing the most-needed scenarios for an account and token control. Waves smart contracts have a two-level mechanism with an own first-level language designed for smart contracts interaction, RIDE. On September 10th, Waves Platform released a new version of node \(block 1,190,000\) supporting their first implementation, Non-Turing complete Smart contracts.

RIDE has smart accounts and smart assets for embedding the calculation system. This level has a simple-syntax functional language for scripting with pre-calculated complexity due to Turing-incompleteness. Implementation of the smart contract language has 5 principal stages \(Begicheva & Smagin, 2018\):

1. Parsing,

2. Compilation,

3. Deserialization,

4. Cost computation,

5. Evaluation.
