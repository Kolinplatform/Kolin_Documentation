# Kolin Public

  
The public version of Kolin will be the principal platform for information exchange. Here the community will vote for different technical topics of interest and the winner one will be transferred to specialized writers. Writer volunteers will generate an article about the topic with a decoded language, thus, transforming technical knowledge in to common language. Thereafter, this article will be uploaded free of access to the platform, where specialized translators will take the document and will translate it to as many languages as possible. Finally, community will evaluate whether the article is simple enough for common public understanding or needs revision. Writers and translators will be paid in Kolin automatically, by the numer of words “decoded” or “translated” respectively. The social section will be divided in different areas of speciality replicating what Universities does by creating i.e. Faculties for Education, Technology, Languages, Politics, Arts, Science etc.
